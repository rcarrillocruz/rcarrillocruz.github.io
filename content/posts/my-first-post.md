Hi! My name is Ricardo Carrillo Cruz. 

I have been working in tech for almost
20 years, mostly in infrastructure and automation space.

I am currently a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat, where I'm working in the Ansible/Service Delivery
organization, doing many different things as a member of the productization team.

My main interests are cloud computing, networking, CI/CD, AI/ML, programming and tinkering with tech in general.

I made several attempts of having a tech blog in the past few years, I hope I can stick to this one
and I provide a good cadence of blog posts.

Thanks for reading!
