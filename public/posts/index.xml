      <description>Hi! My name is Ricardo Carrillo Cruz.
I have been working in tech for almost 20 years, mostly in infrastructure and automation space.
I am currently a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat, where I&amp;rsquo;m working in the Ansible/Service Delivery organization, doing many different things as a member of the productization team.
My main interests are cloud computing, networking, CI/CD, AI/ML, programming and tinkering with tech in general.
I made several attempts of having a tech blog in the past few years, I hope I can stick to this one and I provide a good cadence of blog posts.</description>
